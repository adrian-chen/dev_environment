# New laptop setup

## Atom setup
* Settings -> Themes -> Solarized Dark
* Packages -> tree-view -> Settings -> Hide Ignored

## Solarized Dark & Powerline
* Will need to go into Terminal Settings and set Solarized Dark and the default
* Will also need to set a correct Powerline font. I prefer Meslo M currently.
* After this, remove the files: `rm -rf solarized`
