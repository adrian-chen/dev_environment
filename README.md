# New laptop setup

1. Install Brew: https://brew.sh/
Don't forget to run the commands at the end!

2. Run the following output:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/adrian-chen/dev_environment.git
cd dev_environment
brew bundle
```

## Atom setup
* Settings -> Themes -> Solarized Dark
* Packages -> tree-view -> Settings -> Hide Ignored

## Solarized Dark & Powerline
* Will need to go into Terminal Settings and set Solarized Dark as the default.
* Will also need to set a correct Powerline font. I prefer Meslo M currently.
